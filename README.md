# Angular assignment

The purpose of this repository is to create an application that consumes data from
API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and shows all available doctors, doctor details and their corresponding
tasks.

## Development

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change
any of the source files.

## Running tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

The vast majority of the app requires only UI/UX presentation, testing UI/UX is fickle at best as the costs of
maintaining and updating the tests don't justify the marginally increased confidence in the tests themselves.

To show that I know how to create and run tests, there's only one test called `missing.component.spec.ts`, and it covers
content projection.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
